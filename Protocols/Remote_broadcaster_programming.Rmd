Note, the following directions apply to the [CN101 DC 12V digital programmable timer switch](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cn101+timer+12V+16A).

1. **Clear/reset the timer.**
    a. Press the smaller, inset `C` button on the timer. After a few seconds, the unit will reset. This ensures you are working from a clean slate before each deployment.

1. **Put the timer into manual mode.**
    a. If the timer is locked (i.e., there is a \locked{} icon in the lower left corner of the display), press the `C/R` button 4X.
    b. If a \manual{} icon (some older models), or `OFF` is indicated along the bottom of the display, proceed to the next step.
    c. If no \manual{} icon, or `AUTO` or `ON` is indicated along the bottom of the display, press the `MANUAL` button until either the \manual{} icon (some older units) or `OFF` appears along the bottom of the display (newer units).

1. **Set the day of the week and time of the timer.**
    a. Visit [time.gov](https://time.gov/) for current official time.
    b. While holding the \myclock{} button, use the `D+` button to set the current day of the week, the `H+` button to set the current hour, and the `M+` button to set the current minute. If no button is pressed for 2 seconds while holding the \myclock{} button, you will need to release the \myclock{} button and push/hold it again to further adjust the day of week or time.

1. **Set the remote broadcast unit program.**
    a. Determine the broadcast sequence to be programmed using the [BLRA Remote Broadcast Unit Sequence List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KYLsfPsZMw3fH8PDqI03tctwRroWYiiYVCUiZZ_uTCg/edit?usp=sharing).
    b. Every sequence available in step 4a requires scheduling the `ON/OFF` times for \underline{three} programs. They \underline{do not} necessarily occur on consecutive days. When programming a broadcast sequence, pay careful attention to the days of the week and the `ON/OFF` timing of the three programs.
    c. Consult the [ARU programming calendar](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uYrN7_upLw7_05BjhedVMq4-FEvroqcR) for the scheduled `ON` times of the three programs associated with the relevant sequence and start date of the broadcast sequence. Ensure you are using the programming schedule associated with the \underline{start date of the broadcast}, not necessarily the current or set (deployment) date.
    d. Programming begins by setting the `ON` time for the first program (i.e., `Program 1`). Press the \circled{P} button to advance to the programming interface. The timer display should indicate `ON` and the number `1`.
    e. Repeatedly press the `D+` button until the correct day of the week for `Program 1` is indicated.
    f. Set the appropriate `ON` time for the program using the `H+` and `M+` buttons.
    g. Press the \circled{P} button to advance and set the `OFF` time for `Program 1`, using an approach similar to that described in steps 4e - 4f. Set the `OFF` time for \underline{13 minutes after} the `ON` time.
    h. Press the \circled{P} button to advance to the `ON` time for `Program 2`. The timer display should indicate `ON` and the number `2`.
    i. Repeat steps 4e - 4g to set the `ON` and `OFF` day of the week and times for `Program 2`.
    j. Repeat steps 4h - 4i to set the `ON` and `OFF` day of the week and times for `Program 3`.
    k. When finished setting the `OFF` time for `Program 3`, press the \myclock{} button to exit the programming interface.
    l. Repeatedly press \circled{P} to cycle through and double-check the days and `ON/OFF` times of the three programs against the ARU programming calendar.
    m. Repeat step 4l. Seriously...
