Note, the following directions apply to the [FAVOLCANO CN101 DC 12V 16A Digital Programmable Timer Switch](https://www.amazon.com/FAVOLCANO-CN101-Digital-Programmable-Switch/dp/B012FSL2GK).

1. **Update the date and time of the timer.**
    a. Visit [time.gov](https://time.gov/) for current official time.
    b. While holding the \myclock{} button, use the `D+` button to set the current day of the week day, the `H+` button to set the current hour, and the `M+` button to set the current minute, as necessary. If no button is pressed for 2 seconds while holding the \myclock{} button, you will need to release the \myclock{} button and push/hold it again to further adjust the day of week or time.
    

1. **Set the remote broadcast unit program.**
    a. Determine the broadcast sequence to be programmed using the [BLRA Remote Broadcast Unit Sequence List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KYLsfPsZMw3fH8PDqI03tctwRroWYiiYVCUiZZ_uTCg/edit?usp=sharing).
    b. Every sequence available in step 2a requires scheduling the `ON/OFF` times for \underline{three} programs. They \underline{do not} necessarily occur on consecutive days. When programming a broadcast sequence, pay careful attention to the days of the week and the `ON/OFF` timing of the three programs.
    c. Consult the [ARU programming calendar](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uYrN7_upLw7_05BjhedVMq4-FEvroqcR) for the scheduled `ON` times of the three programs associated with the relevant sequence and start date of the broadcast sequence. Ensure you are using the programming schedule associated with the \underline{start date of the broadcast}, not necessarily the current date.
    d. Programming begins by setting the `ON` time for the first program (i.e., `Program 1`). Press the \circled{P} button to advance to the programming interface. The timer display should indicate `ON` and the number `1`.
    e. Repeatedly press the `D+` button until the correct day of the week for `Program 1` is indicated.
    f. Set the appropriate `ON` time for the program using the `H+` and `M+` buttons.
    g. Press the \circled{P} button to advance and set the `OFF` time for `Program 1`, using an approach similar to that described in steps 2e - 2f. Set the `OFF` time for \underline{13 minutes after} the `ON` time.
    h. Press the \circled{P} button to advance to the `ON` time for `Program 2`. The timer display should indicate `ON` and the number `2`.
    i. Repeat steps 2e - 2g to set the `ON` and `OFF` day of the week and times for `Program 2`.
    j. Repeat steps 2h - 2i to set the `ON` and `OFF` day of the week and times for `Program 3`.
    k. When finished setting the `OFF` time for `Program 3`, press the \myclock{} button to exit the programming interface.
    l. Repeatedly press \circled{P} to cycle through and double-check the days and `ON/OFF` times of the three programs against the ARU programming calendar.
    m. Repeat step 2l. Seriously...
